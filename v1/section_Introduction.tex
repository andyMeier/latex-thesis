State of the world \newline

machine learning employed for automatic decision-making

two good reasons to make those systems transparent:



The big BUT\newline
--- Xerox experiment [32] \newline
--> similar experiment but with automatic decision systems supporting a human (augmented intelligence)
                           
Research questions:\newline
\textbf{RQ 1:} What influence does the accuracy of an automatic decision system have on user's trust?\newline
\textbf{RQ 2:} To what extent is user's trust influenced by the truthfulness of automatically generated explanations?\newline
\textbf{RQ 3:} What role does the truthfulness of an explanation play for the user's perceived understanding?\newline

Therefore, we did\newline
The key findings are\newline
The contributions of this work are\newline
In HCI, the purpose of empirical contributions is to reveal formerly unknown insights about human behaviour in relation to information or technology.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I truly believe that creativity and ideas are never the effort of a single person. \newline
I owe profound gratitude to my supervisors, Dr. C. Seifert and Dr. G. Englebienne, who supported me throughout every stage of the project with constructive and inspiring discussions and practical advice. My grateful thanks are also extended to the Human-Media Interaction Group, and the Data Science Group of the University of Twente for supporting this research financially. I would also like to thank Dr. K.P. Truong for advising me on the measurement of trust, and Dr. R.B. Trieschnigg for encouraging me to tackle this thesis topic in the first place. Finally, I wish to thank my wonderful husband for the countless discussions and his critical mind.\newline
